-- EmoteSets --

The events that an object responds to are grouped into EmoteSets.

Here are some of the common types of EmoteSets:

Use - called when a player double-clicks the NPC
Give (object id) - called when a player gives a particular object to the NPC.
Refuse (object id) - called when a player attempts to give a particular object to the NPC.
Heartbeat - called every 5 seconds

A full list of all the EmoteSet types can be found in EmoteCategory.cs

All emote tables begin with an event type, followed by a colon. For example:

Use:

This would be the line to start defining what happens the player double-clicks the NPC

Give: 1234

This would be the line to start defining what happens when the player gives object #1234 to the NPC

By default, an NPC will not accept or just take any random object from players. The Give emote sets can be seen as a whitelist for which types of objects the NPC will accept from the player.

Refuse: 5678

If the player attempts to give object #5678 to the NPC, and you want the NPC to not accept the item from the player as usual, but you also want the NPC to perform additional actions after refusing the item.

When the player attempts to give object #5678 to the NPC, the object will remain in the player's inventory, and the player will receive the message "You allow <NPC name> to examine you <item name>." The NPC will then perform the emotes listed under the Refuse: 5678 emote set.

Heartbeat:

This is called every 5 seconds for the NPC. If you want the NPC to scratch their head every ~20 seconds for example, you could set up a Heartbeat emote set with a 25% chance

-- Emotes --

After you define an EmoteSet, the lines that follow are 1 or more Emotes that you want to run for that EmoteSet. For example:

Give: 1234
	- Tell: Thank you, I have received item #1234.
	
When the player tries to give item #1234 to the NPC, the action will succeed, and the item will be removed from the player's inventory.

The NPC will then tell the player "Thank you, I have received item #1234."

Use:
	- Motion: Wave
	- Tell: Hello there!

For this example, when the player double-clicks the NPC, the NPC will first wave, and then they will tell the player "Hello there!"

Here is the same emote table, with ensuring the NPC turn to the player before greeting them:

Use:
	- TurnToTarget
	- Motion: Wave
	- Tell: Hello there!

* Branching emotes

Some of the emotes above are prefixed with *. The Goto, Inq*, and Update* emotes are branching emotes.

A branching emote Inquires some particular criteria on the player or in the current world state, and then splits off into 2 separate paths depending on the result of that inquiry.

For example, to check if the player has the War Magic skill trained:

Use:
	- InqSkillTrained: War Magic
		TestSuccess:
			- Tell: You have the War Magic skill trained.
		TestFailure:
			- Tell: You don't have the War Magic skill trained.
			
In the above example, when the player double-clicks the NPC, the NPC will check if the player has the War Magic skill trained. If they do, the NPC will tell the player "You have the War Magic skill trained." If they don't, the NPC will tell the player "You don't have the War Magic skill trained."
